 * SECURITY: This function is only called from REPL.tsx after the "trust this folder"
 * dialog has been confirmed. The trust dialog in cli.tsx blocks all execution until
 * the user explicitly trusts the current working directory, ensuring that plugin
 * installations only happen with user consent. This prevents malicious repositories
 * from automatically installing plugins without user approval.
