 *
 * When offscreen, returns the same ReactElement reference that was cached during
 * the last visible render. React's reconciler bails on identical element refs, so
 * the subtree never re-renders, producing zero diff.
 *
 * The cache is one slot deep: the first re-render after scrolling back into view
 * picks up the live children. Content still updates normally while visible.
