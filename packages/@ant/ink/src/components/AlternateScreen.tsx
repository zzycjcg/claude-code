 * Run children in the terminal's alternate screen buffer, constrained to

 *
 * - Enters the alt screen (DEC 1049), clears it, homes the cursor
 * - Constrains its own height to the terminal row count, so overflow must
 *   be handled via `overflow: scroll` / flexbox (no native scrollback)
 * - Optionally enables SGR mouse tracking (wheel + click/drag) — events
 *   surface as `ParsedKey` (wheel) and update the Ink instance's
 *   selection state (click/drag)
 *
 * On unmount, disables mouse tracking and exits the alt screen, restoring
 * the main screen's content. Safe for use in ctrl-o transcript overlays
 * and similar temporary fullscreen views — the main screen is preserved.
 *
 * Notifies the Ink instance via `setAltScreenActive()` so the renderer
 * keeps the cursor inside the viewport (preventing the cursor-restore LF
 * from scrolling content) and so signal-exit cleanup can exit the alt
 * screen if the component's own unmount doesn't run.
